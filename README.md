## Hello üëãüèæ

I am Ukeje Goodness, a Software Engineer and Technical writer. I love to build efficient, scalable services and share knowledge acquired from the process.

I've contributed to documenting large open-source projects like Canonical, Cosmos SDK, IBC Protocol, Sui Foundation, etc., and worked as a technical writer for various organizations and publications, including LogRocket, DigitalOcean, Axelar Network, and many others.

## What I'm currently interested in

I'm interested in working on open-source developer tooling and optimizing the developer experience via the tools/libraries they use daily. Learn more about me [here](https://goodylili.github.io/about)
